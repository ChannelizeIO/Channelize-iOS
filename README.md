# Channelize-iOS
 Sample app illustrating how to build applications with the Channelize IOS SDK

The following documentation is built to help you with installing our iOS SDK into your project.

Before we begin, please do make sure that

 - Your application is built on iOS 9.0 or above. Since Channelize SDK as of now only supports Version 9.0 or higher.
 - You have Xcode 9.4.1 or later as your IDE to install and run Channelize SDK on iOS.

The Channelize SDK can be installed using the following method

Firstly, you will need to register on Channelize: https://channelize.io/pricing
